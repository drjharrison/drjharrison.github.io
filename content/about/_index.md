![This is me][1]

My LinkedIn page details what has masqueraded as a career path - from setting up an independent environmental virology testing labatory at 29, moving to a stint on internet call centres which lead to building full service contact centres across New Zealand, migrating to the UK, working in Technology companies, Digital Agencies and now a consultant at ThoughtWorks. It's been a journey, and it's never been planned.

My talks and workshops are based around disucssion - talking about thorny topics with a sense of humour and the occasional truth bomb. I am able to command a large stage, and enliven a small room.

I always try to leave an audience with tangible small things they can do to be more inclusive - things that do not need policy or paperwork - they only need action.

Always entertaining, energetic and thought provoking.

#### Podcasting
I host the [It Is Complicated](https://shows.acast.com/it-is-complicated/) podcast with Josephine Baird - where we discuss all manner of topics, and where the answer to pretty much any question is, "It's complicated".
