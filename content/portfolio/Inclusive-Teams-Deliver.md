Inclusive Teams Deliver

Or what I've learnt from 20 years of working with teams

Itâ€™s been almost 20 years since the Agile Manifesto was created. How has it changed the way we work? Is the way forward about what we do, how our teams look or how we think? 

This session presents years of research done with many TW teams - and a way forward, intertwined with the Agile Manifesto. We give a vision for the future that builds on what the best teams already do - but often do unknowingly. By making these actions a mindset, conscious and thoughtful, we can have huge impacts.
