This is my guide for supporting Trans people when the anti-trans pile on happens online (it's all through Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram etc).

It is ten ways you (yes you!) can be a supporter and an ally online - there are many more of you than there are trans people, and there are many more of us all than the noisy anti-trans statement spouting trolls.
<!--more-->
1. Support us - Repost/Like/Share and amplify trans and non-binary voices
2. Block/Report abusers - when you see statements that are abusive/hateful report them in the platform
3. Don’t feed the trolls - ignore them
4. It’s Transphobe not TERF - one is accurate one “is a slur" (TERF is short for Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist - it was originally their chosen nomenclature, it is now considered a slur)
5. "Gender critical" is also transphobia 
6. Be intersectional - recognise your cis/white/het and so on normative privileges - and support minority voices
7. Don’t abuse back - ignoring the trolls is best - yes we might want to so much - be the bigger better person
8. Don't Repost/RT or share in any way transphobic articles - anyone trans or non-binary has already seen them - don’t give them the traffic
9. If you can, support artists/trans people when they do fundraisers - this is the queer anarchist penny - we celebrate raising under £200 for a charity - so your tenner will mean a LOT! More than a tenner will mean an awful lot!
10. Don’t accept that online spaces have to be a torrent of vileness - add cats and happy gifs wherever possible.

By doing these things - you’ll make our online communities a little bit safer, a little bit nicer, and give anyone who is stressed out space to stay on-line. Like all diaspora we trans and non-binary people use online spaces to find and connect with people like us - by making the spaces nicer and safer we can find our communities and see ourselves in the fabulous glorious mix we are.
